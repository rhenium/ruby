This document is a list of user visible feature changes made between
releases except for bug fixes.

Note that each entry is kept so brief that no reason behind or

== Changes since the 2.3.0 release

=== Language changes

=== Core classes updates (outstanding ones only)

* Array
  * Array#max and Array#min.  [Feature #12172]
    This may cause a tiny incompatibility: if you redefine
    Enumerable#max and call max to an Array, your redefinition will be
    now ignored.  You should also redefine Array#max.

* Dir

  * Dir.empty?.  [Feature #10121]

* String

  * String.new(capacity: size) [Feature #12024]

* Symbol

  * Symbol#match now returns MatchData.  [Bug #11991]

* MatchData

  * MatchData#named_captures [Feature #11999]

=== Stdlib updates (outstanding ones only)

* CSV
  * Add a liberal_parsing option. [Feature #11839]

* optparse
  * Add an into option. [Feature #11191]

=== Stdlib compatibility issues (excluding feature bug fixes)

=== Built-in global variables compatibility issues

=== C API updates

* ruby_show_version() will no longer exits the process, if
  RUBY_SHOW_COPYRIGHT_TO_DIE is set to 0.  This will be the default in
  the future.

=== Supported platform changes

=== Implementation improvements

* In some condition, `[x, y].max` and `[x, y].min` are optimized
  so that a temporal array is not created.  The concrete condition is
  an implementation detail: currently, the array literal must have no
  splat, must have at least one expression but literal, the length must
  be <= 0x100, and Array#max and min must not be redefined.  It will work
  in most casual and real-life use case where it is written with intent
  to `Math.max(x, y)`.
